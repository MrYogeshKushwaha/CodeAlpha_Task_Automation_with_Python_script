One of the most repetitive tasks many people face is keeping their file system organized. For instance, the "Downloads" folder on your computer can quickly become cluttered with various files like PDFs, images, documents, and installation packages.

Goal:

Create a Python script that automatically organizes files in the "Downloads" folder into subfolders based on file type. For example:

Images (.jpg, .png, etc.) go into an "Images" folder.
Documents (.pdf, .docx, etc.) go into a "Documents" folder.
Installation files (.exe, .dmg, .zip, etc.) go into an "Installers" folder.
